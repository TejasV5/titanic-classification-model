Titanic Logistic Regression with Model Comparison

This project applies logistic regression to the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. The notebook includes the complete workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and comparison with other machine learning models.

Description
The Titanic Logistic Regression project aims to build a predictive model to determine the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The dataset includes various attributes of the passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, and more. The goal is to use these features to predict whether a passenger survived or not using logistic regression and compare its performance with other models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Random Forest.

Skills Used
